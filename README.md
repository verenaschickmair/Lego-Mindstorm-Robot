# Lego_Mindstorm_Robot
Together with a fellow student, we programmed a Lego Mindstorm Robot which took part in a race against 5 other robots.
The code was written with the programming language Java. The robot was controlled by a bluetooth remote control.
It could drive via remote control or autonomously.
